In this blog I hope to capture my journey at Launch School as I progress as a developer. I also hope to amass a small number of 'How To's' and information in the other sections of this website.  

Initially this site will be a bit of a work in progress, as I build up my skills, I plan to improve the site layout and functionality. For now, I'm happy with how it works, my main requirements we being able to write posts in Markdown wiht code highlighting. I would like to improve the hightlighting, specifically the backgroud colour, and what is selected when you double click on a block. At the moment, it does not easily allow a user to double click to select the whole block, as is common on other sites, it also seems to add an extra space at the end of some lines. I am also not able to change the backgroud colour without it looking a bit funny. This is what it looks like at the moment:

```ruby
# Ruby code...
def hello_world
  puts "Hello World!"
end

hello_world
#=> Hello World!
```

Improvements are on the todo list...  


Well, for now that's it. Hopefully going forward I will be adding a few more posts, and bits of knoweledge as I come accross them.
